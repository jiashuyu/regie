Use Case: Register for Class
ID: UC 01
Pre-condition:
    The student is enrolled in the university and has an account in the system.
Post-condition:
    The student is registered for the class if the department chairperson does not cancel the class due to the class
    having fewer than 5 students.
Primary Flow of Events:
    1. The student logs into the system using their university credentials.
    2. The student browses and selects desired courses and corresponding labs, if applicable.
    3. The system checks in real-time if the student meets all prerequisites for the selected courses.
    4. The system verifies if adding the course exceeds the student's course limit per quarter.
    5. If all checks pass, the student is registered for the course.
    6. The system confirms successful registration to the student and send an email confirmation.
Alternative Flow of Events:
    A4. If the student attempts to exceed the course limit, the system marks the registration as pending and sends an
    email for department chair approval, with a cc to the student's academic advisor and the student.
    A5. For courses requiring instructor consent, the registration is marked as tentative until approval.
Exceptional Flow of Events:
    E3. If prerequisites are not met, the student is informed and the course is not added.
    E5. If a course is full, the system will suggest an alternative section or time of the class.
